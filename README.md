# cds-case-study

Hello! Welcome to the project I developed for the CDS technical interview.

If you would like to run the application in your browser, please follow the steps below.

Note: I was unable to deploy this application on a public web hosting service in time for this submission (I ran into trouble due to my unfamiliarity with deploying non-static websites), but you can still run the application on a local server.

## How to run the application:

- ##### Step 1: Download and Install XAMPP
  - Link to download XAMPP: https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html
- ##### Step 2: Open XAMPP Control Panel.
- ##### Step 3: Click the "Explorer" or equivalent file browser button on the control panel.
- ##### Step 4: Move this cds-case-study repository into XAMPP's "htdocs" folder.
  - You can download this repository by pressing the green "<> Code" button and clicking "Download ZIP".
  - Extract the ZIP and move the extracted folder into XAMPP's "htdocs" folder.
  - Rename the extracted folder "cds-case-study".
- ##### Step 5: Start your local server
  - Go back to XAMPP's Control Panel.
  - Click the "Start" button for the Apache module.
- ##### Step 6: Run the website in your browser
  - Go to your browser's URL bar.
  - Enter "localhost/cds-case-study" (you will have to use a different name if you didn't rename the unzipped folder).

You are now running the web application. Yay!

## Using the application:
From the homepage, you will have the option to go to either the user's view or the admin's view. Just select which options you'd like and press the "Go" button.

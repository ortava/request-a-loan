Hello! Welcome to the project I developed as a case study where the goal was to develop a full-stack website with defined features in ~4 days.

If you would like to run the application in your browser, please follow the steps below to set up a local web server.

## How to run the application (Windows):

- ##### Step 1: Download and Install XAMPP
  - Link to download XAMPP: https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html
- ##### Step 2: Open XAMPP Control Panel.
- ##### Step 3: Click the "Explorer" or equivalent file browser button on the control panel.
- ##### Step 4: Move this request-a-loan repository into XAMPP's "htdocs" folder.
  - You can download this repository by pressing the green "<> Code" button and clicking "Download ZIP".
  - Extract the ZIP and move the extracted folder into XAMPP's "htdocs" folder
    - Make sure there is no folder of the same name when you open the extracted folder. If there is, move it out and use that folder.
  - Rename the extracted folder "request-a-loan".
- ##### Step 5: Start your local server
  - Go back to XAMPP's Control Panel.
  - Click the "Start" button for the Apache module.
- ##### Step 6: Run the website in your browser
  - Go to your browser's URL bar.
  - Enter "localhost/request-a-loan" (you will have to use a different name if you didn't rename the unzipped folder).

You are now running the web application. Yay!

## Using the application:
- From the homepage, you will have the option to go to either the user's view or the admin's view. Just select which options you'd like, and press the "Go" button.
- You can press the title header at the top of each view to go back to the home page when you want to switch users or switch to admin.
